Please download files from
http://bcgsc.ca/downloads/tasrkleat-static/off-cloud/, keep with the same
directory structure.

```
./data/metadata
./reference_data
./results_data
```

Then in each subdirectory where the notebooks are to be run, you could create
symlinks for the needed data directories.
